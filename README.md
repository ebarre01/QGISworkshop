# QGIS Workshop: Mapping prejudice in Nashville's infrastructure 

Workshop objectives:
* Understand the historic and contemporary links between structural   racism and its manifestations in the built environment, and the potential of using mapping technologies to explore those relationships  
* Develop a basic understanding of how to use QGIS to visualize spatial data, as well as foundational cartographic design choices 
* Access additional resources to develop independent mapping projects 

Part 1: 
* Racialized geographies 101
* Tutorial: QGIS foundations & best data management practices 
* Goal: Download & import data 

Part 2:
* Cartography 101
* Tutorial: Visualizing spatial data & basic design principles 
* Goal: Create map & spatial narrative
